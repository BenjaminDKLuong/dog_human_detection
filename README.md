# Dog Identification App

In this project, I developed a CNN to classify dog breeds.  After that, I used the CNN in human_and_dog algorithm

## How the human_and_dog algorithm work:
- if a dog is detected in the image, return the predicted breed.
- if a human is detected in the image, return the resembling dog breed.
- if neither is detected in the image, provide output that indicates an error.
